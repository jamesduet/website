## Summary

- **Total SVG files**: 33
- **Total size**: 122.8 MB
- **Files over 200KB**: 26 files (79%)
- **Files over 1MB**: 20 files (61%)
- **Largest file**: img_service_5.svg (21.1 MB)

## Analysis

Most large SVG files contain embedded base64-encoded JPEG/PNG images, making them essentially wrapper containers for raster images. These should be converted to optimized WebP format for better performance.

## Recommendations

1. **Convert to WebP**: 26 files over 200KB should be converted to WebP format
2. **Estimated size reduction**: 70-80% reduction in file size
3. **Lazy loading**: Implement for images below the fold
4. **Keep as SVG**: Only 7 small files (under 15KB) should remain as SVG

## Next Steps

1. Convert large SVG files to WebP format
2. Update HTML references to use WebP with SVG fallback
3. Implement lazy loading attributes
4. Test image quality and performance
