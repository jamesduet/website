                      We use the information collected to serve you in five
                      primary ways – for Shuttle Service Rides, to direct the
                      Shuttle Service's vehicle and driver to pick you up and
                      drop you off at the locations that you prefer; for our
                      carpool service, to help you find other users who are
                      geographically close to you or share a part of your
                      commute route, to match commute schedules, to contact the
                      users that you would like to carpool with, and to
                      communicate with other users to arrange a carpool.

                    <p>
                      We use your Personal Information that you submitted when
                      signing up for an account to send you an activation code
                      or link through text message for you to activate your
                      account, as well as a welcome email for you to verify your
                      account. We will communicate with you by email, phone, or
                      text message to address your questions, provide our
                      support to you, and keep you updated regarding our
                      services.

                    <p>
                      We use the addresses or location information that you and
                      other users submitted to construct a user community for
                      each user. In addition, we will disclose certain parts of
                      your Personal Information to other users in your community
                      to help users arrange carpools among themselves, or
                      Shuttle Services to pick you up and drop you off. The
                      information that we disclose is your first name, the first
                      initial of your last name, your profile photo and vehicle
                      photo, your phone number, your commute locations and
                      schedules as well as the verification confirmations you
                      provide to us. When you either offer a ride to or request
                      a ride from another user in Duet applications, we will
                      send an email message and an in-app chat message in our
                      mobile application on behalf of you to this user. The
                      email will include basic information about you and your
                      commute to help the recipient user evaluate whether he or
                      she can carpool with you, and to allow the recipient user
                      to respond to you with his or her decision. Your
                      information in this email includes your first name, the
                      first initial of your last name, profile photo,
                      verification status, and the names of the cities of your
                      two commute locations, your commute schedule and your
                      suggested carpool date. The in-app chat message will
                      include the carpool date that you select. By using the
                      option of offering or requesting a ride in the Duet
                      applications, you have given us your consent to share the
                      aforementioned information of yours with the Duet user
                      whom you select to carpool with.

                      We may review, scan, or analyze your communications with

                      for sending third-party marketing messages to you. We will
                      also not sell these reviews or analyses of communications
                      to third parties. We will also use automated methods to
                      carry out these reviews or analyses where reasonably
                      possible. However, from time to time we may have to
                      manually review some communications. By using our mobile
                      applications, you consent that the Company, in its sole

                      We use your browsing, searching and registration history

                      joining a Carpool, you agree that you will meet your
                      Confirmed Carpool Partners at the scheduled pickup
                      location and at the scheduled pickup time, and, if you are
                      the Driver, that you will drop off the Riders at the
                      scheduled dropoff location. Unlike direct transportation,
                      carpool travel typically takes longer as riders wait for
                      fellow passengers to load or unload. In addition to being
                      affected by other passengers sharing the ride, travel time
                      is dependent on geography, weather condition, time of day,
                      and traffic conditions. Duet and the Drivers and Shuttle
                      Services partners are not responsible for delays in
                      anticipated pickup or arrival. Duet has no obligation to
                      display any Carpool you create and reserves the right to
                      display Carpools to users at Duet's discretion.

                    <p>
                      You can cancel a Carpool only through the Applications.
                      Fees will apply if you cancel a Confirmed Carpool as
                      specified in Section 3. If you cancel a Confirmed Carpool
                      less than ten minutes before the scheduled pickup time,
                      Duet will consider you a No Show for that Confirmed
                      Carpool. In addition to fees, if you are a No Show
                      (whether by late cancellation or otherwise) for three
                      Confirmed Carpools in any calendar month, you will be
                      blocked from the Platform and Services through the end of
                      the following calendar month. If you are blocked a second
                      time, you will be permanently blocked from the Platform
                      and Services.

                    <p>
                      You will use the Application to designate each Confirmed
                      Carpool as "Pickup Complete," "Cancelled" or "No Show"
                      (each a "<strong>Claim</strong>"). Duet will not accept
                      Claims other than through the designated claim function in
                      the Application. Whether or not you make a Claim, Duet
                      will determine the Claim status of each user registered
                      for a Confirmed Carpool within 24 hours of the scheduled
                      departure time. You accept that Duet's determination of
                      Claim status is final.

                      You will have the option to perform certain verifications

                      email account, Facebook account, and LinkedIn account.
                      Duet recommends you perform these verifications, which are
                      factored into other users' consideration of carpooling
                      with you. Duet may enforce some or all of the supported
                      verifications in order to improve your carpooling success

                      this Section 3 ("<strong>Charges</strong>"). With respect
                      to Carpools, Duet will charge the Rider a "<strong
                        >Carpool Fee</strong

                      an amount to reimburse the Driver (the
                      "<strong>Reimbursement</strong>"). With respect to Rides
                      for Shuttle Services, Duet will charge the Rider a Charge
                      specified at the time you schedule the Ride (the "<strong

                      allows you to pay into your account in fixed increments

                      use of Promotions by you or any other user in the event

                      of owning and operating the Driver's vehicle) associated
                      with driving successfully completed Confirmed Carpools.

                      Reimbursement for that Carpool after you have created or

                      the right, in Duet's reasonable discretion, to adjust or
                      withhold all or a portion of a Reimbursement (a) if Duet

                      costs or reimbursable expenses for that Carpool. You must
                      comply with any and all applicable tax Law, including the

                      determining if any Reimbursement is taxable, and for
                      remitting taxes to the appropriate tax authority.

                        Legal Claim submitted to arbitration will be decided by
                        a single, neutral arbitrator (the
                        "<strong>Arbitrator</strong>") mutually agreed by the

                        of the commencement of arbitration, in accordance with
                        the Rules. The Arbitrator must be qualified as a
                        California attorney who has at least ten years of prior
                        combined professional experience either as a judge or in

                        exclusively by means of conference telephone or other
                        communications technology, as reasonably determined by
                        the Arbitrator, by means of which all persons
                        participating in those hearings or conferences can hear
                        each other, and neither the parties, the Arbitrator or
                        any attorneys, witnesses or other representatives of the
                        parties will be required to be physically present in any
                        particular place for purposes of any hearing or
                        conference unless the Arbitrator determines that a
                        physical hearing is necessary to effectively arbitrate
                        the Legal Claim, in which case that physical hearing
                        will be in a location selected by the Arbitrator to be
                        reasonably convenient to the parties and the Arbitrator.
                        The Arbitrator will have the exclusive power to
                        adjudicate the alleged breach, enforcement,
                        interpretation or validity of this Agreement, including
                        as to the scope or applicability of this
                        <strong>Section 12.10(b)</strong>. Discovery within an

                        <strong>Section 12.10(b)</strong> will be limited as
                        reasonable or necessary by the Arbitrator. If there is
                        more than one Legal Claim between the parties, all such
                        Legal Claims may be heard in a single arbitration under
                        this <strong>Section 12.10(b)</strong>. Except to the
                        extent required by applicable Law that cannot be waived
                        or modified by this Agreement, Legal Claims under this
                        Agreement may not be consolidated into a single
                        arbitration proceeding with disputes between Duet and
                        other persons, even if those Legal Claims are governed
                        by an arbitration proceeding similar or identical to
                        this <strong>Section 12.10(b)</strong> and even those
                        other persons are similarly situated and their disputes
                        are similar or identical in the nature to a Legal Claims
                        under this Agreement. All JAMS fees and costs will be
                        borne equally by the parties, except that in rendering
                        the award, the Arbitrator will allocate and award an
                        appropriate share of the prevailing party's reasonable
                        attorneys' fees and costs, to the losing party. Judgment
                        on any arbitration award may be entered and enforced by
                        any court of competent jurisdiction. This
                        <strong>Section 12.10(b)</strong> will not preclude a
                        party from seeking emergency injunctive relief from
                        courts of appropriate jurisdiction as to any rights or
                        obligations under this Agreement requiring such
                        emergency injunctive relief, provided that the Legal
                        Claim will thereafter be resolved exclusively by
